# Introduction


Population dynamics are a key aspect of the current biodiversity change. Many species have experienced population declines across the world, even the most common species. On the other hand, particular groups of species, for instance generalists, human commensals or species with affinity for warm habitat have increased.


There are multiple means to assess the changes in species populations. Among those, Multi Species Index (MSI) enables to summarise the main trajectory of a group of species. MSI are therefore commonly used as proxies to evaluate the state of a given milieu based on groups of species that share a similar habitat. Despite the ability of MSI to provide information about a group of species, all population do not follow the same pattern. More specifically, aggregating the dynamics of several populations into one trajectory can hide trajectories with opposite trend, i.e. a stable MSI could emerge from an similar amount of increasing and decreasing populations. We still lack of approaches that distinguish groups of species according to their main trajectory while keeping the habitat information given by aggregated indices like MSI.

Dynamic Factor Analysis


# Materiel and methods

## Bird data

Data on abundance of breeding common bird in Sweden have been obtained from @lindstromSwedishBirdSurvey2021. Abundances of 252 bird species have been monitored between 1996 and 2020 on 716 fixed routes consisting in eight 1km-line transects. Counting has been carried out between 20 May and 5 July of each year and has consisted in reporting all bird except young of the year heard or seen, while slowly walking along the transect. 

## Bird time-series

Time-series have been computed for the 168 species with enough data (more than three consecutive year with data, less than four consecutive year without data, data from the first year, a median of occurrence per year > 3, a median of abundance per year > 5 and an overdispersion < 2) between 1998 and 2020 as the number of routes monitored in 1996 and 1997 was relatively low [@lindstromDistributionPopulationChanges2007].

For each species yearly variations from the first year have been obtained using a quasi poisson Generalised Linear Model as follows:

$$
log(\operatorname{Abundance}_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_i + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{Year}_j) + \beta_{2}(\operatorname{Route}_k) + \epsilon
$$
This gave us yearly abundance index for each species and the associated uncertainty.
