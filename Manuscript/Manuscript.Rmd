# Introduction


# Materiel and methods

## Bird data

Data on abundance of breeding common bird in Sweden have been obtained from @lindstromSwedishBirdSurvey2021. Abundances of 252 bird species have been monitored between 1996 and 2020 on 716 fixed routes consisting in eight 1km-line transects. Counting has been carried out between 20 May and 5 July of each year and has consisted in reporting all bird except young of the year heard or seen, while slowly walking along the transect. 

## Bird time-series

Time-series have been computed for the 168 species with enough data (more than three consecutive year with data, less than four consecutive year without data, data from the first year, a median of occurrence per year > 3, a median of abundance per year > 5 and an overdispersion < 2) between 1998 and 2020 as the number of routes monitored in 1996 and 1997 was relatively low [@lindstromDistributionPopulationChanges2007].

For each species yearly variations from the first year have been obtained using a quasi poisson Generalised Linear Model as follows:

$$
log(\operatorname{Abundance}_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_i + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{Year}_j) + \beta_{2}(\operatorname{Route}_k) + \epsilon
$$
